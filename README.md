# GridView_Practice
In android GridView is a view group that display items in two dimensional scrolling grid (rows and columns), the grid items are not necessarily predetermined but they are automatically inserted to the layout using a ListAdapter. Users can then select any grid item by clicking on it. GridView is default scrollable so we donâ€™t need to use ScrollView or anything else with GridView.
